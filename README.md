Project Summary: Overall, I had a lot of fun creating this landing page. It was a good opportunity to review what I have learned so far, and it gave me the confidence to take on the challenge of creating the actual website for Tekin Drainage. One of my greatest challenges was creating a responsive website that would look great on any device. However, this became a big achievement for me because it pushed me to more deeply understand Flexbox through trial and error.
